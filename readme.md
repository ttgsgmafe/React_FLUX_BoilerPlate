# React / Flux Boilerplate (ES5)

A simple boilerplate used form my own personal education of the React and Flux environment based on the PluralSight course.

My goal is to build this into a more substantial foundation for framing React-based projects.

This Boilerplate is built using ES5

Requirements
- Boostrap
